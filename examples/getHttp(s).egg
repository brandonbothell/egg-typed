# since egg only allows for one application per file, everything needs to be in a do() function.
do(
  # we define `callback` to a function that takes in data, you can do whatever with the data from the request
  define(callback, fun(data, print("Successfully got with http"))),
  httpGet("http://postman-echo.com/get?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2", callback),

  # we do the same thing as before but with an inline function and https
  httpsGet("https://postman-echo.com/get?foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2", fun(data, print("Successfully got with https")))
